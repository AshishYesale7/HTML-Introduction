HTML Attributes
<li >All HTML elements can have attributes </li>
<li>Attributes provide additional information about elements</li> 
<li> Attributes are always specified in the start tag</li> 
<li>Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"</li> 


The < a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

 Syntax : < a href="https://www.ashish.com"> Sample </ a>

 <h1>The src Attribute </h1>


 The < img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

  Syntax : < img src="test.jpg" >



<p>There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:</p>

<li>1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.ashish.jpg/test.jpg". </li>

<b> Notes: </b> External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

<li>2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="test.jpg". 
       If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/test.jpg". </li>

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.


<h2>The width and height Attributes </h2>


The < img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

<b>Syntax :</b> <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
