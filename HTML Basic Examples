<p>In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.

Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.


This code defines a basic HTML document with the following elements:
</p>

<!-- 
!DOCTYPE html >: This declaration specifies the document type as HTML.
 
<html>: This tag is the root element of the HTML document.

<h1> Explanation of code </h1>

The  < html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
     
  It has a start tag < html> and an end tag </ html>.

         Then, inside the < html> element there is a < body> element:
          The < body> element defines the document's body.

            It has a start tag < body> and an end tag </ body>.
            
                     Then, inside the < body> element there are two other elements: < h1> and < p>:

                      The < h1> element defines a heading.

                        It has a start tag < h1> and an end tag </ h1>:

                        The < p> element defines a paragraph.

                          It has a start tag < p> and an end tag </ p>:


    <h2>  Never Skip the End Tag </h2>

    Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag:

    < p > This is a paragraph
    < p > This is a paragraph

    Empty HTML Elements
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

The < br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:



<h1 >HTML is Not Case Sensitive </h1>

HTML tags are not case sensitive: < P> means the same as < p>.

The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTML.
